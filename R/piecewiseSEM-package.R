#' Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling
#'
#' Fitting and evaluation of piecewise structural equation models, complete
#' with goodness-of-fit tests, estimates of (standardized) path coefficients,
#' and evaluation of individual model fits (e.g., through R-squared values).
#' Compared with traditional variance-covariance based SEM, piecewise SEM
#' allows for fitting of models to different distributions through GLM and/or
#' hierarchical/nested random structures through (G)LMER. Supported model
#' classes include: \code{lm, glm, gls, lme, glmmPQL, lmerMod, merModLmerTest, 
#' glmerMod, sarlm, Sarlm}.
